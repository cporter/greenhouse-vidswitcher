greenhouse-vidswitcher
======================

A simple video switcher using [Oblong](http://oblong.com/)'s Greenhouse SDK.

Written originally for [FTC Team 4628 The Suit Bots](http://suitbots.com/) to
show their videos at [FIRST Tech Challenge](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc)
tournaments.  The Suit Bots' tournament display routes input via a
[MaKey MaKey](http://makeymakey.com/).  Input via
[g-speak mobile](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/g-speak-mobile/id460504931?mt=8)
is supported as well.

Building
--------

You'll need the following to build greenhouse-vidswitcher

* Oblong's Greenhouse SDK installed in /opt/oblong/Greenhouse
* Xcode command line tools

Those requirements satisfied, building should be a simple matter of running `make`.
The resultant binary is called "`vids`."

Running
-------

`vids` demands one argument: A list of the videos that you want to display.  Its format
is as follows

    !<tag:oblong.com,2009:slaw/protein>
    descrips:
    - vids
    - config
    ingests:
      videos:
      - { file: "/path/to/video/1.mov", title: "First Title", audio: .3 }
      - { file: "/path/to/video/2.mp4", title: "Title Two", audio: .2 }
      - { file: "/path/to/more/videos.mov", title: "More Titles", audio: .5 }

The videos will be displayed in the order that they are described.  The keys describing
the individual videos are as follows:

* **file**: The path to the video file
